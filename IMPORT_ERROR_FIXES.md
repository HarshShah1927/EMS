# Import Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Original Error
```
[plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "./lib/database" from "src\App.tsx"
```

### 2. Root Cause
Multiple frontend files were importing from `./lib/database` which was deleted as part of the architecture fix to separate frontend and backend concerns.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/App.tsx`
**Problem**: Importing `connectDB` from deleted `./lib/database`
**Solution**: 
- Removed `import { connectDB } from './lib/database'`
- Removed `import { getUserById, loginUser }` (replaced with `getCurrentUser`)
- Removed database connection logic and state
- Updated to use `getCurrentUser()` for session validation
- Removed database connection error UI

### 2. `src/components/SalaryManagement.tsx`
**Problem**: Importing types from deleted `./lib/database`
**Solution**:
- Changed `import { Employee, Salary, AdvanceSalary } from '../lib/database'`
- To `import { AuthUser, Employee, Salary, AdvanceSalary } from '../types'`
- Types are properly defined in `src/types/index.ts`

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Incorrect)
```
Frontend Files → Direct Database Imports → Mongoose Models
```

### After (Correct)
```
Frontend Files → Types from ../types → API Calls → Backend → Database
```

## Verification

✅ No more imports from `./lib/database` in frontend
✅ All types imported from proper `../types` location
✅ Authentication uses API service instead of direct DB access
✅ App initialization simplified to work with API calls
✅ No database connection handling in frontend

## Commands Run

```bash
# Fix App.tsx
git add src/App.tsx && git commit -m "Fix App.tsx: Remove database import and update to use API-based authentication"

# Fix SalaryManagement.tsx
git add src/components/SalaryManagement.tsx && git commit -m "Fix SalaryManagement.tsx: Update imports to use types instead of deleted database file"

# Push all changes
git push origin cursor/setup-and-enhance-employee-management-system-4c6e
```

## Result

The frontend should now load without import errors and work properly with the API-based authentication system. All database operations are handled by the backend, and the frontend only deals with API calls and type definitions.

## Login Credentials
- **Email**: admin@yourcompany.com
- **Password**: SecurePassword123!

The application should now work correctly with proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
